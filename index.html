    <h1>Pixelator</h1>
    <h4>
      By Isabelle Lee
    </h4>
    <h4>I. Description</h4>
    Pixelator turns images into arrays of integers that represent pixel data. There are four 
    <br> numbers for each pixel denoting red, green, blue, and alpha (opacity) values that 
    <br> range from 0 to 255. 
    <br>
    <br> I chose a set of 200 pixels by 200 pixels images that the user could choose from.
    <br> Because this would yield a total of 40,000 pixels and 4 data points for each, which 
    <br> would result in an array with 160,000 elements, I chose to average the values of
    <br> 100 pixel regions after separating them into their respective red, green, blue, and
    <br> alpha arrays. This resulted in 4 arrays of length 400 each. 
    <br>
    <br> I then fed these arrays into different oscillators and filters to produce and 
    <br> manipulate the sound. I attached frequency of the sound to the array of red pixel data,
    <br> and frequency would increase for regions with more red. I attached the resonance, or 
    <br> brightness, of the sound to the array of blue pixel data. I fed it into the parameter 'Q'
    <br> for a biquad filter. I attached the tremolo the sound to the array of green pixel data,
    <br> and attributed increased intensity of tremolo to increased concentration of green in the region.
    <br> I unfortuantely could not do much with the alpha value, because all my images were uniform 
    <br> in opacity, and it would not lead to useful nor interesting manipulations of sound.

    <h4>II. Images</h4>
    I chose to use images from the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist period of art, spanning from 
    <br> the mid-1800s to early 1900s. I always found art from this period very fascinating, and chose
    <br> famous works from three famous artists - Piet Mondrian, George Seurat, and Vincent van Gogh.
    <br>
    <br> The first button, "Galaxy", is just a generic image I used for testing the early stages of 
    <br> this project. It had a simple blend of colors so I could track if changes were being made 
    <br> in the sound correctly. 
    <br> 
    <br> Piet Mondrian's distinct artistic style was one that valued geometric shapes, overlooked 
    <br> natural form and color, and mainly used straight lines to form rectangular areas. When his 
    <br> painting is put through the Pixelator, notice that it sounds much more robotic and jagged
    <br> compared to the other images, due its sharp borders and abrupt color changes.
    <br>
    <br> George Seurat's style is softer and much more blended. The chosen work of art <i>A Sunday on La 
    <br> Grande Jatte</i> (1884), is an example of style he pioneered called pointilism. When zoomed in,
    <br> one can see that the image is made up of small dots. The sound produced by this image is varied
    <br> because there is a diverse pallette of color.
    <br>
    <br> Vincent van Gogh's style has changed throughout his life time. I chose one of his most well-known
    <br> works of art <i>The Starry Night</i>
